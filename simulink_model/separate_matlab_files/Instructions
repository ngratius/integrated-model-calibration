Simulation environment requirements: 
 - MATLAB R2022a or older
 - Install the following packages
    - MATLAB
    - Simulink
    - Simscape
    - Simscape Fluids
    - Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

How to use the Simulink Model:
1) Open STEVE_ver28.slx and the .m file on the condition that you want to run
2-a) For data generation, run the first section (NOT the entire code) of the .m file
2-b) For prognostics, set the CO2 concentration (line 10 in the .m file of interest) to 0.003. Then, run the section
3) Hit the Start button on the .slx file to start the simulation
4-a) For data generation, hit the stop button after you run roughly 300 sec (=5min) since that's the only data you'd really need
4-b) To run prognostics, run until the simulation automatically ends
5) Run the second section of the .m file. A csv file will be created on the path that you are on.
